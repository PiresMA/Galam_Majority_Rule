# Monte_Carlo_Simulation_By_Examples
Coming soon: Here I will present several simple examples to illustrate how to conduct a Monte Carlo Simulation. 
More specifically, I will put here:
1) Opinion dynamics: Galam's majority rule, voter model and Sznajd model
2) Epidemic models: SI,SIS and SIR 
3) Random Walks and Diffusion
