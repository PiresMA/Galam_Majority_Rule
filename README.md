# Monte_Carlo_Simulation_By_Examples
 Galam's majority rule is a minimal model that describes the emergence of global consensus from local agents interactions. Also, it 
 is a quite simple model that illustrates the use of Monte Carlo Simulation and in particular, agent-based simulation. In this 
 model, we choose at random a group of 3 agents. If there is a local majority (2Ã—1) in favor of one of the two possible opinions, 
 the individual with minority opinion will follow the local majority.
