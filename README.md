# Monte_Carlo_Simulation_By_Examples
 Galam's majority rule is a quite simple model that illustrates the use of the Monte Carlo Simulation and in particular, agent-based simulation. In this model, we choose at random a group of 3 agents. If there is a local majority (2Ã—1) in favor of one of the two possible opinions, the individual with minority opinion will follow the local majority.
